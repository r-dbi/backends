## [AzureKusto](https://github.com/Azure/AzureKusto) 1.0.6 (2020-04-27) [:link:](https://github.com/Azure/AzureR) [:bug:](https://github.com/Azure/AzureKusto/issues)

Interface to ‘Kusto’/‘Azure Data Explorer’

An interface to ‘Azure Data Explorer’, also known as ‘Kusto’, a fast,
highly scalable data exploration service from Microsoft:
<https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/data-explorer/>. Includes
‘DBI’ and ‘dplyr’ interfaces, with the latter modelled after the
‘dbplyr’ package, whereby queries are translated from R into the
native ‘KQL’ query language and executed lazily. On the admin side, the
package extends the object framework provided by ‘AzureRMR’ to support
creation and deletion of databases, and management of database
principals. Part of the ‘AzureR’ family of packages.

## [dittodb](https://dittodb.jonkeane.com/) 0.1.3 (2020-10-10) [:link:](https://github.com/ropensci/dittodb) [:bug:](https://github.com/ropensci/dittodb/issues)

A Test Environment for Database Requests

Testing and documenting code that communicates with remote databases can
be painful. Although the interaction with R is usually relatively simple
(e.g. data(frames) passed to and from a database), because they rely on
a separate service and the data there, testing them can be difficult to
set up, unsustainable in a continuous integration environment, or
impossible without replicating an entire production cluster. This
package addresses that by allowing you to make recordings from your
database interactions and then play them back while testing (or in other
contexts) all without needing to spin up or have access to the database
your code would typically connect to.
