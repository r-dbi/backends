  "description": "In order to make Arrow Database Connectivity ('ADBC' <https://arrow.apache.org/adbc/>) accessible from R, an interface compliant with the 'DBI' package is provided, using driver back-ends that are implemented in the 'adbcdrivermanager' framework. This enables interacting with database systems using the Arrow data format, thereby offering an efficient alternative to 'ODBC' for analytical applications.",
