  "description": "Embeds the SQLite database engine in R and provides an interface compliant with the DBI package. The source for the SQLite engine and for various extensions in a recent version is included. System libraries will never be consulted because this package relies on static linking for the plugins it includes; this also ensures a consistent experience across all installations.",
