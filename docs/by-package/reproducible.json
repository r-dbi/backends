  "description": "Collection of high-level, machine- and OS-independent tools for making deeply reproducible and reusable content in R. The two workhorse functions are Cache and prepInputs; these allow for: nested caching, robust to environments, and objects with environments (like functions); and data retrieval and processing in continuous workflow environments. In all cases, efforts are made to make the first and subsequent calls of functions have the same result, but vastly faster at subsequent times by way of checksums and digesting. Several features are still under active development, including cloud storage of cached objects, allowing for sharing between users. Several advanced options are available, see ?reproducibleOptions.",
